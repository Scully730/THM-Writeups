Firstly, we use Netcat figure out what's behind port 1337 as hinted on the machine's description on THM.
  
~/Downloads > nc 10.66.149.214 1337                
Welcome traveller, to the beginning of your journey
To begin, find the trollface
Legend says he's hiding in the first 100 ports
Try printing the banners from the ports

Looking at the results from the Nmap scan, we find that port 111 and 2049 are running an NFS service. Now we enumerate NFS

~/Downloads > showmount -e 10.66.149.214                                                                                                                                                                                       took 16m 33s
Export list for 10.66.149.214:
/home/nfs *

We now mount the directly into our machine.

~/Downloads > sudo mount -t nfs 10.64.154.247:/home/nfs /mnt/nfs

~/Downloads > ls /mnt/nfs                                                                                                                                                                                                          took 10s
