I was given a compiled binary named .Compiled. Running it prompted me for a password:

Password: 

Decompiling the binary with Ghidra showed this interesting line:

__isoc99_scanf("DoYouEven%sCTF", local_28);

and string comparisons against:

__dso_handle
_init

At first glance, this suggested a password in the format DoYouEven_<something>CTF. I tried values like:

DoYouEven_initCTF
DoYouEven__dso_handleCTF

…but they all failed with “Try again!”.

🔑 The Trick

After testing carefully, I realized the decompiler’s representation of scanf wasn’t entirely accurate. The program was really checking only for:

DoYouEven_init

Once I entered that, I got the “Correct!” response.
